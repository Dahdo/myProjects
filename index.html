      <p>Hello guy! This is my first web page ever made by me- Mr. Daniel Ndashimye. So, I decided to tell you how coming to scholl today was. Actually, I came to school today not for studying but requesting for internship in the machine tool workshop. Luckly I got it!!! Here are below are some steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We first arrived at school</li>
        <li>We went to request for internship</li>
        <li>Fortunately, we got it</li>
        <li>But we was supposed to come on Monday</li>
        <li>That was great to me</li>
        <li>Because I was in need of some time to read</li>
        <li>We decided what we were going to do at that time</li>
        <li>finally, we came up with one idea</li>
      </ul>
